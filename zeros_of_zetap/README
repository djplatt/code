File to count and locate zeros of zeta'

NB THIS IS A NON-RIGOROUS IMPLEMENTATION

molin.c uses the rigorous quadrature method of Molin but without error bounds to
compute 1/2pi i int zeta''/zeta'(s) ds around boxes specified by left right bottom and bottom+step, moving up by step each time and doing <its> iterations.

<N> is the number of points used in the quadrature routine
<prec> is how many bits of precision to use.

newton.c uses Newton-Raphson on a grid of points in each box to try and locate the zeros of zeta' therein.
newton1.c does the same but on a finer mesh.

Ideally the number of zeros found by newton(1) would match the prediction from Molin but is sometimes doesn't, I think because of zeros of zeta' close to the contour of the integration. However, over the long run, these errors seem to cancel out.

The zeros found by count were

the final 3 used newton1 to find 3 missing zeros from original trawl of 90,000-100,000 where newton only found 14210.
