Code for Chacha at RIKEN

Count zeros of L'(chi,.) in rectangle 0->1/2->1/2+t0i->t0i->0
where t0>6/log(q)

Uses argument principle so computes
1/2 pi i int L''/L' (s) ds

Since L' and L'' are entire (chi non principal) this counts zeros.

Uses arb for interval arithmetic and Molin's rigorous double 
exponential quadrature.

Will fail if a zero lives on contour, e.g. chi_11(10,.)

results2 contains output for primitive characters, q in [3,215]

output is parsed into zerofind_even.gp and zerofind_odd.gp

These are then read by current*/maple/chacha/zerofind.gp (amended to
read odd then even) with output to bar with 3 blank lines in between.
zerofind.gp uses 10 its of N-R at default precision starting from z=0 
to find zeros.

The entry for chi_11(10,.) is added by hand (0.173809.... 0.0)

bar is then ploted by pyxplot chacha.pyx to create pyxplot.eps
this is converted to pdf by epstopdf
