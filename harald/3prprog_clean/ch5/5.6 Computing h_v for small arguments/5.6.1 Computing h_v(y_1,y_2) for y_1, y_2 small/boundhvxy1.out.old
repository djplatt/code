The following bounds concern f_{1,2}(x), defined as
	 inf_{r x <= y <= 1000000} sqrt(x y) h_2(x,y) for r=1.
Then, for 1<=x<=1000000/r, where r=1,
f_{1,2}(x) >= -4.07843742
and f_{1,2}(x)/x >= -0.4310163289; that value may be reached near x=5
The integral of f_{1,2}/x^2 from 0 to infty is at least -1.011644465
The integral of min(0,f_{1,2})/x^2 from 0 to infty is at least -1.011644465
Define F_{1,2}(x) = max_{1<=t<=x} (-f_{1,2}(t)).
Then the integral of F_{1,2}(x)/x^2 from 0 to infty is at most  1.034883548
