These files run a quick test on the Xeon Phi processor

We first build a version of GMP cross compiled for the Xeon Phi

I used version 5.1.3 build using Intels icc (lives in /opt/intel/bin/)

  $ ./configure CC=icc --host=x86_64 CFLAGS=-mmic --disable-assembly

I then did make

The program test.c is then built using the makefile and copied to the xeon phi
using sftp mic0

The (sh) script run_test.sh is also copied over. This creates 227 instantiations of test and waits for them all to complete.

and either run locally by
ssh mic0 'time ./run_test.sh'

or after ssh'ing to mic0

I got a run time of ~44 seconds with 152' 35" of User time (about x208)
