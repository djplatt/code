Stuff for Kieran Ryan

His email (see replies)

Dear Dave,

 

I hope you are well. My name’s Kieran Ryan, I’m a PhD student at Queen Mary University of London.

 

I have a question which, if you have time, I hope you might help me with. I have a fairly innocuous inequality which I’m trying to prove. I can prove it with an extremely prolonged series of taylor expansions, but I am wondering if there is some accessible way to achieve a computer-assisted proof of a problem like this? I realise it is not a huge problem, I am just inexperienced with such proofs!

 

3/2 + (1+5z)*log(z)/(4(1-z)) + log((-z*log(z))/(3(1-z)+(1+z)*log(z))) > 0 for 0<z<1; (the function is zero at z=1).

 

Many thanks,

Kieran
