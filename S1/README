Directory contains code to compute S1(t)-N1(t)-T-1/pi int_0^t theta(w) dw

where theta is the Riemann Siegel theta and N1(t) = int N(t) dt with N(t) counting non-trivial zeros of zeta

S168_pi computes S1(168 pi)

S1_v1 computes |S1(t)| or |S1(t)-S1(168 pi)| from t=0 to 530 (>168 pi)
in small intervals checking that it doesn't exceed A0 + A1 log t

with A0=2.067 and A1=0.059

No attempt made to make it efficient as its a once in a lifetime calculation.

If we want to go much higher than 530, some work may be needed as the width of the intervals needed decreases with t, so the run time increases accordingly.
