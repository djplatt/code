Use Low/Purdey/Watkins ideas to eliminate exceptions zeros of Dirichlet L-functions of primitive odd real characters. Uses DJ Platt's int_double interval
arithmetic package (Lambov) which in turn uses crlibm.

Note, int_double relies on setting the rounding mode for sse instructions to
round down. It is essential that crlibm is built using -mfpmath=387 -frounding-math so that it uses the fpu and not sse.

Equally, when compiling watkins_int_double1.0.cpp etc, we need
-msse2 -mfpmath=387 -frounding-math. I also restrict optimisation to -O1 -finline-functions -fomit-frame-pointer

Finally, I compile against int_double12.0.h rather than the later versions, some of which seem iffy.

watkins_seg.c contains an unfinished implementation using ARB

watkins_seg_int_double1.0.cpp is the current version
