In what follows, $p$ will be a positive integer prime.

We are considering $\mathcal{A}$, the set of $n\geq n$ such that $n-p^2$ is square-free for all $p\leq\sqrt{n}$ and $A(N)$ which counts the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ $\leq N$.

We are perturbed that our naive approach grossly underestimated $A(N)$. We thought $A(2^23)$ should be about $1.2$ but the actually count is $9\,384$.

There are three issues I think.
\begin{itemize}

\item The first observation is that we have ruled out those $n\equiv 1\mod\;4$ but we should also rule out $n\equiv 0\mod\;4$ since $4|(n-2^2)$. This actually makes things worse as it reduces our estimate for $A(2^{23})$ even further.
  
  \item We are assuming that the probability the $n$ is square free, say $P(n)$ to be $1/\zeta(2)$ regardless of the size of $n$. This argument follows from
$$
P(n)=\prod\limits_{p\geq 2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right)=\frac{1}{\zeta(2)}.
$$
However, this is not tight unless $n$ is large, for some definition of ``large''.

Our difficulty is that $n-p^2$ may not be large, even when $n$ is. The worst case is the prime just less than $\sqrt{n}$ which will typically be of size $p_E=\sqrt{n}-1/4\log n$. In this case $n-p_E^2=1/2\sqrt{n}\log n-1/16\log^2 n$. 

A better estimate for small $n$ might be
$$
P_1(n)=\prod\limits_{p=2}^{\sqrt{n}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right)=\frac{1}{\zeta(2)\prod\limits_{p>\sqrt{n}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right)}.
$$

\item
Now if $n\equiv 2\mod\;4$ or $n\equiv 3\mod\;4$ then $4\nmid(n-p^2)$ so we need to adjust our probability to
$$
P_2(n)=\prod\limits_{p=3}^{\sqrt{n}}\left(1-\frac{1}{p^2}\right)=\frac{4}{3}P_1(n).
$$
\end{itemize}

The upshot of all this (if you agree its reasonable) is that the chance of a random $n\not\equiv \{0,1\}\mod\;4$ being in $\mathcal{A}$ is
$$
P_{A}(n)=\prod\limits_{p=2}^{\sqrt{n}}P_2(n-p^2)
$$
and the expectation for $A(N)$ is
$$
\sum\limits_{n=2}^{N/4} P_A(4n+2)+P_A(4n+3).
$$

Running a simple single thread program in Pari even my puny desktop can get to $N=2^{30}$ overnight (actually a little under $10$ hours). Using $4$ threads I went to $2^{31}$. The largest member of $\mathcal{A}$ found was $581\,424\,623$ so by the time we reached $2^{31}$, we hadn't seen one for over $1\,560\,000\,000$. I conjecture that there aren't any more.
