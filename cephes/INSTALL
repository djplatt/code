Precompiled libraries and programs are supplied here for ix86-linux.

There are five separate libraries, corresponding to different
numerical precisions.  They use a common configuration file called
mconf.h.  Edit this as required for your computer and copy it to each
subdirectory you intend to build.

In the subdirectory for each library, there is a unix-style makefile
and perhaps also some other types of batch control files.  Check these
and possibly enable the machine-dependent assembly language options
appropriate for your computer.

Note that there are some test programs in each directory.

After building the libraries and running the tests, copy the library
archive files to a location such as /usr/local/lib that your linker
program will search.  Copy the C++ header qlib/qfloat.h to an include
directory such as /usr/local/include that your C preprocessor will
search.  Each subdirectory contains a file named "protos.h" with ANSI
prototypes for the library functions; you can copy these out as desired.
